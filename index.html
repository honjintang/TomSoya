    <p>OUR STORY</p>
    <br>
    <p>Jessie, our founder, grew up in a family obsessed with food – good quality home-cooked Chinese food. And tofu had always been a big part of that. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Her great-grandfather had been the village tofu-maker and the secrets to rustling up amazing tofu was passed from generation to generation. However growing up in the UK meant that it was hard to buy authentic tofu, and even harder to convince her friends that tofu was a delicious and easy alternative to meat. She was told it was ‘bland’ and ‘texture-less’ – so she set out to prove them wrong!</p>
    <br>
    <p>We are at an early stage in our story and are soon to sell our tofu kits in a London street market. We would love to hear from you about anything – a question, a quick chat or an idea for collaboration!</p>
